# ChineseRecognition

- Didn't like google translate's writing feature for practicing Chinese 
- App includes writing screen that will give a list of recognized characters by using googles MLKit for both recognition and translation
- Uses hanzi-tools javascript library to translate characters into their pinyin

- App also includes second screen showing most frequently written characters (usually in the context of how I'd use this, those would be the ones I 'forget' the most while studying)
